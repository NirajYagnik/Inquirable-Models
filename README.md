## Inquirable Models


The proposed work aims to bridge the gap between complex algorithmic decisions and patient
comprehension and trust by developing a user-interactive risk prediction model. The work seeks
to engineer these interactions with the help of Large Language Models to allow users to query
complex mathematical models using general human language. This approach enhances the
transparency of machine learning models in healthcare and empowers patients with a deeper
understanding of their health risks. By allowing for direct, comprehensible dialogues about
model outputs, we aim to foster trust and provide actionable insights. The project aims to
achieve more informed healthcare decisions and patient-centric care.

## Directory Structure

- Dataset
  Contains the two dataset used for the work. More specifically the diabetes detection dataset and heart failure prediction dataset.

- Risk Model Notebook
  Contains the notebooks used for training the risk models on the respective datasets.

- Result Sheet
  Excel sheet with responses on each question asked to each model.


For GPT4, GPT3.5 and CustomGPT, the questions were manually fed to the interface and the following inference upon data edit is carried out manually too. 
For LLAMA, the process is automated and illustrated in folder Llama2 Notebook.
